# Growth Mindset

>Growth mindset is being able to look at challenges, speed bumps and setbacks, in a light that causes you to be able to push through to a larger version of yourself.

Some ways to keep in a growth mindset are:


-Treat yourself with respect, the same way you would treat a friend that is struggling with a challenge.

-Try to realize that if you continue to chip away at an obstacle, you will eventually make it through it.

-Remember that it is difficult to learn new things, but over time with practice they will become easier.
